      "content": "Born and raised in the Netherlands with Indonesian roots, Isa Warps has turned her passion for football into a professional career spanning two continents. From her first steps on the pitch at DBS Eindhoven at a young age, she knew that football would shape her life.\n\nAfter years of development at Dutch clubs such as FC Eindhoven and RKSV Nuenen, Isa made the move to the international stage. At KRC Genk Ladies in Belgium and NAC Breda in the Eredivisie Vrouwen, she refined her skills and developed into a versatile attacker.\n\nIn 2023, a dream came true when she was selected for Timnas Putri Indonesia, the Indonesia Women's National Team. With 6 international caps and her first international goal to her name, she proudly represents her Indonesian heritage on the world stage.\n\nSince 2025, Isa has been playing for VfR Warbeyen Frauen in the German 2. Bundesliga, where she tests herself daily against top-level players. Her pace, technique and shooting ability make her a dangerous attacker who can play across multiple positions.\n\nBeyond her career on the pitch, Isa is committed to the development of women's football, particularly in Indonesia. She believes that sport has the power to inspire young women and create opportunities."
